# 17. Architecture description


The architecture description must be provided by the target manufacturer
in the form of a library P4 source file that contains at least one
declaration for a `package`; this `package` must be instantiated by the
user to construct a program for a target. For an example see the Very
Simple Switch declaration from Section \[\#sec-vss-arch\].

The architecture description file may pre-define data types, constants,
helper package implementations, and errors. It must also declare the
types of all the programmable blocks that will appear in the final
target: `parser`s and `control` blocks. The programmable blocks may
optionally be grouped together in packages, which can be nested.

Since some of the target components may manipulate user-defined types,
which are unknown at the target declaration time, these are described
using type variables, which must be used parametrically in the
programâ€”i.e., type variables are checked similar to Java generics, not
C++ templates.
