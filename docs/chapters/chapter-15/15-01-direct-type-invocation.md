Controls and parsers are often instantiated exactly once. As a light
syntactic sugar, control and parser declarations with no constructor
parameters may be applied directly, as if they were an instance. This
has the effect of creating and applying a local instance of that type.

```p4
control Callee(/* parameters omitted */) { /* body omitted */ }

control Caller(/* parameters omitted */)(/* parameters omitted */) {
    apply {
        Callee.apply(/* arguments omitted */); // Callee is treated as an instance
    }
}
```

The definition of `Caller` is equivalent to the following.

```p4
control Caller(/* parameters omitted */)(/* parameters omitted */) {
@name("Callee") Callee() Callee_inst; // local instance of Callee
apply {
    Callee_inst.apply(/* arguments omitted */);         // Callee_inst is applied
}
}
```
    
    ```bison
directApplication
    : typeName "." APPLY "(" argumentList ")" ";"
    | specializedType "." APPLY "(" argumentList ")" ";"
    ;
```

This feature is intended to streamline the common case where a type is
instantiated exactly once.

The second production in the grammar allows direct calls for generic
controls or parsers:

```p4
control Callee<T>(/* parameters omitted */) { /* body omitted */ }

control Caller(/* parameters omitted */)(/* parameters omitted */) {
    apply {
        // Callee<bit<32>> is treated as an instance
        Callee<bit<32>>.apply(/* arguments omitted */);
    }
}
```

For completeness, the behavior of directly invoking the same type more
than once is defined as follows.

  - Direct type invocation in different scopes will result in different
    local instances with different fully-qualified control names.
  - In the same scope, direct type invocation will result in a different
    local instance per invocation—however, instances of the same type
    will share the same global name, via the `@name` annotation. If the
    type contains controllable entities, then invoking it directly more
    than once in the same scope is illegal, because it will produce
    multiple controllable entities with the same fully-qualified control
    name.

See Section [Annotations controlling naming](../chapter-18/18-03-control-plane-names.md#sec-name-annotations) for details of `@name`
annotations.

No direct invocation is possible for controls or parsers that require
constructor arguments. These need to be instantiated before they are
invoked.
