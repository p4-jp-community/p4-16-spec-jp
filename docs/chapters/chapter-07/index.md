# 7. P4 data types


P4<sub>16</sub> is a statically-typed language. Programs that do not
pass the type checker are considered invalid and rejected by the
compiler. P4 provides a number of base types as well as type operators
that construct derived types. Some values can be converted to a
different type using casts. However, to make user intents clear,
implicit casts are only allowed in a few circumstances and the range of
casts available is intentionally restricted.
