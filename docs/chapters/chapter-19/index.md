# 19. Static assertions


The P4 core library contains two overloaded declarations for a
`static_assert` function, as follows:

\~ Begin P4Example /// Static assert evaluates a boolean expression ///
at compilation time. If the expression evaluates to /// false,
compilation is stopped and the corresponding message is printed. extern
bool static\_assert(bool check, string message);

/// Like the above but using a default message. extern bool
static\_assert(bool check); \~ End P4Example

These functions both return boolean values. Since the parameters are
directionless, these functions require compile-time known values as
arguments, thus they can be used to enforce compile-time invariants.
Since P4 does not allow statements at the program top-level (outside of
apply blocks), these functions can be used at the top-level by assigning
their result to a dummy constant, e.g.:

\~ Begin P4Example const bool \_check = static\_assert(V1MODEL\_VERSION
\> 20180000, “Expected a v1 model version \>= 20180000”); \~ End
P4Example

As the comment indicates, if `static_assert` returns `false`, it causes
the program compilation to be terminated immediately with an error.
